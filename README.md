Number of Players: 2

Rules:

On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited and they end u with a score of 0.

Players have to decide when to hold their score which will save their score but forfeit their turn to the opponent.

The first player to reach 100 is the winner.
